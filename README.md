Dengue is the most extensively spread mosquito-borne disease; endemic in more than 100 countries.  The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically over the last few decades.  This is a great concern to the public health in India. The National Capital, Delhi, saw its worst dengue outbreak in 2015, when it claimed 60 lives. The lack of proper prediction mechanism is one contributing factor making the preventive measures not so effective. Our project tries to solve this issue by analyzing patterns in the number of dengue cases with respect to the environmental conditions that effect it. Given the current environmental parameters, the model estimates the extent of outbreak of dengue. This prediction enables the municipal authorities to optimize the preventive measures, thereby preventing dengue efficiently.
